# 46-1 Module overview and modern application core parts

### Component

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. A React component is a reusable piece of code that represents a part of a user interface. Components can be thought of as custom HTML elements that can be reused throughout your application. React components can be either class components or function components. Class components are defined using ES6 classes and function components are defined using JavaScript functions.

### Template

React templates (or React dashboards) are sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces. React templates usually consist of different pages with a pre-built design, stand-alone components, styling (like color themes, icons, fonts, background styles), plugins, widgets, libraries.

### State

In React, components have a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component.

### Routing

React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React that helps you add new screens and flows to your application incredibly quickly, all while keeping the URL in sync with whatâ€™s being displayed on the page
